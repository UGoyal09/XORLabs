# XORLabs

It is just the script file, no HTTML, so it should be run manually and input should also be passed manually into the function. 
A comment is provided in the code where the array needs to be passed, so it can be passed there and the results can be viewed on the console.
I hope the front end is not needed.
If there is any problem in running the file, I will be happy to assist at any time.
